    <h4>1. What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
  
    <h5>The visual creative software genre of Orb.Farm focuses on virtual ecosystem simulators, featuring pixelated graphics and a dynamic equilibrium. It explores the simulation of digital ecosystems and the delicate balance of biological environments.
    </h5>
    <div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>2. List three other examples of software in this genre</h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <li>Ecosystem Simulator
      </li>
      <li> The Life Engine</li>
      <li>The Habitable Planet from Ecology Lab</li>
      <div class="gap4"></div>
    <h4>3. List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max
      explanation per feature/mechanic)
    </h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <li>Pixelated graphic: the overall style features pixelated graphics with a low-resolution landscape background that continuously changes, along with an old-style browser window design.</li>
    <li>Placement: Allows the user to select any species of creature and generate them by clicking or pressing the mouse.</li>
    <li>Dynamic Ecosystem Balance: Displays the levels of CO₂ and O₂, allowing users to decide what to add to maintain balance between them.
    </li>
    <li>Time acceleration: there is a speed-up button inside the window tab that accelerates the daily whereabouts and speeds up changes in the ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Dynamic equilibrium: The pixelated creature either stays the same, changes its form, grows or disappears depending on the ecosystem inside the jar.
    </li>
    <li>Reset: The reset and clear buttons are used to remove all species that have been generated.
    </li>
    <li>Information and control: An info button which allows you to view information about the details of elements in the software. The element is displayed in a tab format with options to minimize, switch between windowed/fullscreen modes, and close.
    </li>
    <li>Self-sustaining ecosystem: the software is programmed as a dynamic environment where pixels interact with each other to demonstrate the dynamic equilibrium and interconnectedness of the ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>Colour: Orb.farm applied desaturated colours and contrast to distinguish the different creatures. 
    </li>
    <div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>4. What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
      conventions?
    </h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <h5>The pixelated elements change over time in response to the ecosystem, which indicates its genre as an ecosystem simulator.</h5>
    <div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>5. What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <h5>Orb.farm provides the user with more freedom and control to create the environment, rather than simply inserting numbers or percentages of species and allowing the system to automatically generate the ecosystem. In which viewers can visually see the lifecycle and position of creatures within the ecosystem.
    </h5>
<div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>6. What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?
    </h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <h5>Orb.farm could add a weather controller for more interactive choices, allowing users to see and test further changes in the ecosystem.
    </h5>
    <div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>7. What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
      indicates this?
    </h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
    <h5>Orb.farm primarily focuses on ecosystem and aquatic nature environments, as indicated through the development of the ecosystem within the jar.
    </h5>
<div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>8. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
     <h5>The options for the elements are limited, which I find boring while interacting with it. If more elements could be added, it would increase the expansiveness and playability of the interactions.
    </h5>
    <div class="gap4"></div>

    <h4>9. What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h4>
    <div class="gap2"></div>
     <h5>
      Orb.farm is similar to art and design creations, providing me with more flexibility in deciding how I want the environment to look and allowing me to virtually view the changes in its ecosystem over time.
      </h5>
